/**
 * TODO: update that comment
 *
 * Backward chaining falls into two cases
 *
 * 1. Truth value query - Given a target atom whose truth value is not
 *    known and a pool of atoms, find a way to estimate the truth
 *    value of the target Atom, via combining the atoms in the pool
 *    using the inference rule. Eg. The target is "Do people breath"
 *
 *    (InheritanceLink people breath)
 *
 *    the truth value of the target is estimated via doing the
 *    inference "People are animals, animals breathe, therefore people
 *    breathe."
 *
 * 2. Variable fulfillment query - Given a target Link (Atoms may be
 *    Nodes or Links) with one or more VariableAtoms among its
 *    targets, figure what atoms may be put in place of these
 *    VariableAtoms, so as to give the grounded targets a high
 *
 *    strength * confidence
 *
 *    Eg. What breathes (InheritanceLink $X breath) can be fulfilled
 *    by pattern matching, whenever there are are multiple values to
 *    fill $X we will use fitness value measure to choose the best
 *    other compound example is what breathes and adds ANDLink
 *    InheritanceLink $X Breath InheritanceLink $X adds
 *
 * Anatomy of current implementation
 * =================================
 *
 * 1. First check if the target matches to something in the knowledge base
 *    already
 *
 * 2. If not, choose an inference Rule R (using some Rule selection criteria)
 *    whose output can unify to the target
 *
 * 3. Reverse ground R's input to restrict the permises search
 *
 * 4. Find all premises that matches the restricted R's input by Pattern
 *    Matching
 *
 * 5. For each set of premises, Forward Chain (a.k.a apply the rule, or
 *    Pattern Matching) on the R to see if it can solve the target.
 *
 * 6. If not, add the permises to the targets list (in addition to some
 *    permise selection criteria)
 *
 * 7. Do target selection and repeat.
