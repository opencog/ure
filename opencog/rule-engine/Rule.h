/**
 * Class for managing rules in the URE.
 *
 * A URE rule may have one of the following formats.
 *
 * 1. A single, forward-only premises-to-conclusion rule, of the style
 *
 *     <premise-1>
 *     ...
 *     <premise-1>
 *     |-
 *     <conclusion>
 *
 * is represented as
 *
 *     BindLink
 *        <variables>
 *        AndLink
 *           <premise-1>
 *           ...
 *           <premise-n>
 *        <conclusion>
 *
 * Here, `<conclusion>` may represent the conclusion pattern explicitly,
 * or, in most cases, it may be obfuscated in a grounded schema node.
 * In such a case, the following format may be used. Note that if the
 * rule uses a `GroundedSchema` and no backward form is used, as
 * described below, then the last argument of the `GroundedSchema`
 * will represent the rule's conclusion pattern.
 *
 * 2. A list starting with a forward-format and, optionally, one or
 * more backward-forms. The backward forms allow the conclusion
 * patterns to be easily obtained, as well as a means to reconstruct
 * the premises, given a conclusion. In this case, a rule is
 * represented as follows:
 *
 *     ListLink
 *        <forward>
 *        <backward-1>
 *        ...
 *        <backward-n>
 *
 * where `<forward>` is the structure described in part 1, above. The
 * `<backward-k>` terms are either
 *
 *      BindLink
 *         <variables>
 *         <conclusion>
 *         AndLink
 *            <premise-1>
 *            ...
 *            <premise-n>
 *
 * or, if we don't need to translate a certain conclusion into premises,
 * such terms take the form
 *
 *      GetLink
 *         <variables>
 *         <conclusion>
 *
 * This second notation (forward and backward forms) is necessary when
 * the forward rule output(s) is obfuscated by a grounded schema(ta).
 * It can also be useful when the transformations going from conclusion
 * to premises are non-trivial. The reason there are several backward
 * forms is because a forward rule may output several conclusions.
 * Take, for instance, the PLN equivalence-to-double-implication rule,
 * that given A<->B, outputs A->B and B->A.
