 * This algorithm perform unification by recursively
 *
 * 1. Generate all equality partitions
 *
 * 2. Decorate partition blocks with types
 *
 * 3. Check that each partition is satisfiable
 *
 * For now the types in 2. are represented by the substitutions, for
 * instance the typed block {{X, A}, A} means that X is A. Later one
 * we will replace that by deep types as to represents things like
 * {{X, Y}, ConceptNode} meaning that X and Y must be concept nodes is
 * order to be satisfiable, of course the deep will still need to
 * capture grounds such as {{X, A}, A}, it's not clear excatly how,
 * maybe Linas deep type implementation can already do that.
 *
 * To solve 3, for each partition block, it computes the type that
 * intersects all its elements and repeat till a fixed point is
 * reached. To do that efficiently we would need to build a dependency
 * DAG, but at first we can afford to compute type intersections is
 * random order.
 *
 * Also, permutations are supported though very slow.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * 1.
 *
 * unify((Variable "$X"), (Concept "A"))
 * ->
 * {{<{(Variable "$X"), (Concept "A")}, (Concept "A")>}}
 *
 * meaning that the partition block {(Variable "$X"), (Concept "A")}
 * has type (Concept "A"), and there is only one partition in the
 * solution set.
 *
 * 2.
 *
 * unify((Concept "A"), (Concept "$X"))
 * ->
 * {{<{(Variable "$X"), (Concept "A")}, (Concept "A")>}}
 *
 * 3.
 *
 * unify((Inheritance (Concept "A") (Concept "B")), (Variable "$X"))
 * ->
 * {{<{(Variable "$X"), (Inheritance (Concept "A") (Concept "B"))},
 *    (Inheritance (Concept "A") (Concept "B"))>}}
 *
 * 4.
 *
 * unify((Inheritance (Concept "A") (Variable "$Y")),
 *       (Inheritance (Variable "$X") (Concept "B"))
 * ->
 * {{<{(Variable "$X"), (Concept "A")}, (Concept "A")>,
 *   <{(Variable "$Y"), (Concept "B")}, (Concept "B")>}}
 *
 * 5.
 *
 * unify((And (Concept "A") (Concept "B")),
 *       (And (Variable "$X") (Variable "$Y"))
 * ->
 * {
 *  {<{(Variable "$X"), (Concept "A")}, (Concept "A")>,

 *
 *  {<{(Variable "$X"), (Concept "B")}, (Concept "B")>,
 *   <{(Variable "$Y"), (Concept "A")}, (Concept "A")>}
 * }
 *
 * mean that the solution set has 2 partitions, one where X unifies to
