Unified Rule Engine examples
============================

Collection of examples using the unified rule engine to demonstrate
forward and backward chaining in OpenCog.

Usage
-----

First, make sure you can run the examples in examples/guile and
examples/pattern-matcher as the rule engine heavily depends on the
pattern matcher.

Then you may have a look at the different subfolders, see their
respective README.md files.
